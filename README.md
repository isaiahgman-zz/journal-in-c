# Journal Application in C by Isaiah Gathala
 
##Purpose
I was just looking for some projects to learn some C and making a journal entry system seemed fun.

##How it Works
There is a username when the program is run. This makes sure that the notes of one person don't get mixed up with another's. There is no password as there is no security implementation.

If the username exists then the "Create New Entry" appends the new entry to the existing entries. If the username is new than a new text file is created. 

Because there are usernames, users also have the option to "Read Existing Entries." This list will showcase all the entries in that username's text file. 

The UI is similar to a BIOS menu. The arrows are used to navigate and enter to select. 

Ncurses was used to make the application take up the whole window and look a little nicer than just normal terminal stuff.
